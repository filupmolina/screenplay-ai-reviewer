= ACT I

INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

Dark, creaky floorboards. Shadows everywhere.

SARAH (20s, nervous) enters through the front door, flashlight in hand.

SARAH
Hello? Is anyone here?

The door SLAMS shut behind her.

SARAH (CONT'D)
(whispered)
Oh god...

She spins around, heart pounding. The flashlight flickers.

= ACT II

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Sarah descends the stairs. Each step GROANS under her weight.

At the bottom, she sees a FIGURE in the corner.

SARAH
Who are you?

The FIGURE turns. It's a GHOST (translucent, pale).

GHOST
You shouldn't have come here.

Sarah screams and runs back up the stairs.

= ACT III

EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah bursts out the front door, gasping for air.

She looks back at the house. The lights inside flicker.

SARAH
(to herself)
Never again.

She runs into the night.

FADE OUT.

THE END
