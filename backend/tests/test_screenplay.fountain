INT. MANSION - LIBRARY - NIGHT

The room is dark except for a single lamp. JOHN (40s, disheveled) paces nervously.

The MAID enters quietly, carrying a tray of tea. She's in her 50s, unassuming.

JOHN
(without looking up)
Just leave it on the desk.

MAID
Of course, sir.

She sets down the tray, but lingers near the doorway.

JOHN
Was there something else?

MAID
I... no, sir. Will that be all?

John waves her away dismissively. The Maid exits, but we see her pause just outside the door, listening.

FATHER (O.S.)
(shouting from upstairs)
John! Get up here! Now!

John sighs heavily and exits.

INT. MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

FATHER (70s, frail but fierce) sits in bed, clutching a LETTER.

JOHN
What is it now?

FATHER
Don't take that tone with me. Sit down.

John reluctantly sits in the chair beside the bed.

FATHER (CONT'D)
I've changed the will.

JOHN
What? You can't be serious.

FATHER
I'm dead serious. You've been wasting your life, boy. The money goes to charity unless you prove yourself.

John stands abruptly, fists clenched.

JOHN
This is insane!

FATHER
(calmly)
You have six months. Show me you're worth something.

INT. MANSION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Maid stands pressed against the wall, just out of sight. She's heard everything. A slight smile crosses her face.

She slips away silently.

INT. MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY

Bright morning light. The Maid prepares breakfast. She hums quietly to herself.

The LAWYER (50s, expensive suit) enters through the back door.

LAWYER
Is he awake?

MAID
Mr. John is still sleeping. The old man's been up since dawn.

LAWYER
(quietly)
And the will?

MAID
Changed. Just like we discussed.

The Lawyer hands her an envelope. She tucks it into her apron without looking at it.

LAWYER
You're playing a dangerous game, Maria.

MAID/MARIA
(cold smile)
I've been playing this game for twenty years. I know exactly what I'm doing.

The Lawyer exits. Maria returns to her breakfast preparations, humming.

INT. MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY

Father and John sit at opposite ends of a long table. Maria serves breakfast silently.

FATHER
Your mother would be ashamed of you.

JOHN
Don't bring her into this.

FATHER
She knew. Before she died, she knew what you'd become.

John slams his fist on the table. Maria doesn't flinch, but her eyes are alert, watching.

JOHN
I've had enough of this.

He storms out. Father watches him go, looking older and more tired.

FATHER
(to Maria)
Do you think I'm being too hard on him?

MARIA
It's not my place to say, sir.

FATHER
But if it were?

Maria pauses, considering carefully.

MARIA
I think... a man needs to earn what he has. Otherwise he doesn't value it.

Father nods slowly.

FATHER
My wife always said you were wise.

MARIA
(with a hint of something dark)
She was very kind to me.

She clears the dishes and exits. Father stares at the empty doorway, troubled.
