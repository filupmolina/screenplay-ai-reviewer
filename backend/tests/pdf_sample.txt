BELLEVUE - Zack Zucker

INT. FELIX’S OFFICE - NEXT LVL AGENCY - LOS ANGELES - DAY
FELIX FUENTES, 33, studies his own eyes, reflected in the
window. With his tan skin wrapped in a bespoke violet suit,
he’s the only pop of color in his large, metallic office.
DEMARCUS (V.O.)
So then you’ll get me the boat?
FELIX
(distracted)
Yup! No prob-- wait, what?! A boat?
INTERCUT - On the phone, in a Lamborghini is DEMARCUS TAYLOR,
24. The giant football player does not fit in this tiny car.
DEMARCUS
I told you! Bitonio re-ups, he gets
a boat. I re-up, it’s “here’s two
jet skis.” I’m not a bitch, Felix!
FELIX
How do jet skis make you a bitch?
DEMARCUS
The nautical ranking system, Felix!
Tom Brady don’t do laps around
Brady Island in a lil’ Kawasaki. I
bet they got Elons to make him a
Tesla catamaran... Is that a boat?
FELIX
A catamaran? Yeah. But I doubt Elon
Musk gave Bitonio a catamaran.
DEMARCUS
Not Bitonio! Tom Brady, man!
Brady’s got the Tesla catamaran!
FELIX
And you want to take it from him?
DEMARCUS
What? No! They don’t even make
Tesla catama-- Damn it, Felix! Stop
making me say catamaran!
FELIX
What are you saying, DeMarcus?
DEMARCUS
The contract’s bullshit! But my
lawyer ain’t even listening to me!
