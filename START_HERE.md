# ⚠️ START HERE - [APP NAME] ⚠️

**CLAUDE: This is the FIRST file to read in EVERY session. Required.**

**FILUP: When opening a conversation about this app, paste this into chat:**

```
I'm working on [app-name]. Read START_HERE.md first, then follow the session protocol.
```

## Quick Start Checklist

### 1. ⚠️ Follow SESSION_PROTOCOL.md (MANDATORY)
This defines how every conversation must start.

### 2. Read These Files (Silently):
1. PROJECT_BIBLE.md - The rulebook
2. SESSION_PROTOCOL.md - Session structure
3. STATUS.md - Current state
4. ROADMAP.md - Priorities
5. ISSUES.md - Blockers

### 3. Present Briefing
- **FIRST SESSION ONLY**: Present the app vision (what it does, key features, the plan)
- **REGULAR SESSIONS**: Minimal 3-line briefing
- Format from SESSION_PROTOCOL.md

### 4. Recommend Action
Always say "Let's do X" - ONE decisive recommendation
