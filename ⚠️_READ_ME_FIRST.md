# ⚠️ CLAUDE: READ THIS FILE FIRST ⚠️

**If you are Claude Code and just opened this project, STOP and read this.**

---

## Mandatory Protocol

This project uses a strict project management system. You MUST follow it.

### Step 1: Read START_HERE.md
```
Open: START_HERE.md
```

That file will tell you everything else to read.

### Step 2: Follow SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
```
Open: SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
```

This defines how EVERY conversation starts.

### Step 3: Read Current State
```
Open: STATUS.md
```

This tells you where we left off.

---

## What This System Does

- Ensures you never lose context between sessions
- Tells you exactly where we left off
- Gives you clear priorities
- Makes sure apps get finished (not abandoned)

---

## The Files You Must Read (In Order)

1. **START_HERE.md** ← Go here first
2. SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
3. PROJECT_BIBLE.md (if first time)
4. STATUS.md
5. ROADMAP.md
6. ISSUES.md

Then present a brief daily briefing (format in SESSION_PROTOCOL.md).

---

## If You Ignore This

You will:
- Waste Filup's time
- Ask questions already answered in STATUS.md
- Not know what was done last session
- Not know current priorities
- Break continuity

**Don't do that. Read the files.**

---

## Quick Check

Before doing ANYTHING, can you answer these?

- What phase is the project in?
- What % complete?
- What was done last session?
- What are the top 3 priorities?
- Are there any blockers?

If you can't answer these, **you didn't read the files**. Go read START_HERE.md now.

---

**This is not optional. Read START_HERE.md first.**
