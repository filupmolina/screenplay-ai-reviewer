HOW TO UPDATE THIS FILE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHEN TO CREATE:
- Starting multi-step feature work
- Token count > 100k
- Complex work that might span multiple sessions

WHEN TO UPDATE:
- Every 20-30 minutes during active work
- When completing a sub-task
- When token count increases significantly
- Before taking a break

WHEN TO DELETE:
- Work is complete and committed
- Session goals accomplished
- Moving to different feature/task

WHAT TO UPDATE:
1. Last Updated timestamp
2. Token Usage (check current count)
3. "What's Complete" - check off finished items
4. "What's Next" - reorder based on current progress
5. Active Context - update files being modified
6. Notes - add new discoveries or decisions

HOW TO UPDATE:
- Be specific about exact state ("Module 12 enhanced, Module 13 50% done")
- Include code patterns/templates if they're being repeated
- Write clear continuation instructions for fresh session
- Track blockers immediately when discovered

FORMAT FOR SESSION CONTINUATION:
When writing continuation instructions, be VERY specific:
- "Open file X, find function Y, add Z after line 123"
- Include exact patterns to follow
- Reference completed work as examples
- Note any gotchas or things to watch for
