## Current Status: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

### What Just Happened (This Session)

#### Completed ✓
1. **Brain Builder Tool** (Session 4)
   - BrainResearcher module (deep research via interviews, analysis)
   - ScreenplayPatternAnalyzer (analyze director's actual screenplays)
   - BrainSynthesizer (combine research + patterns into Horror Brain 2.0)
   - BrainBuilder orchestrator (coordinates full brain building process)
   - Impact: Can now build comprehensive, nuanced Horror Brain personas

2. **Chat with the Pros Feature** (Session 4)
   - BrainChat module (interactive conversations with individual brains)
   - Context-aware (references coverage reports)
   - In-character responses
   - Impact: Can now chat with Horror Brains about feedback

3. **Multi-Brain Debate System** (Session 4)
   - MultiBrainDebate module
   - Private debate mode (brains discuss without user, report back)
   - Goal-focused (best product, not compromise)
   - Impact: Multiple brains can now debate creative decisions

4. **Analysis Storage System** (Session 4)
   - AnalysisStorage module (save/load screenplay analyses)
   - Persistent across sessions
   - Versioned storage
   - Impact: Can now load previous analyses and continue conversations

5. **CRITICAL Lesson Added** (Session 4)
   - Never read Horror Brain PDFs directly (186KB-600KB)
   - Must use extraction or vectorization
   - Added to LESSONS_LEARNED.md
   - Impact: Prevents context window death

#### Previous Sessions:

1. **Modern React Stack Installation**
   - Installed shadcn/ui with 7 core components
   - Installed zustand, react-query, react-hook-form, sonner
   - Impact: Professional-grade tech stack

2. **Upload Interface Modernization**
   - Drag-and-drop upload with validation
   - Toast notifications (replaced alert())
   - Impact: Professional UI

3. **End-to-End Analysis Flow**
   - Fixed backend Scene model bug (location field)
   - First successful full screenplay analysis
   - Jordan Peele + Sam Raimi reviewing Bad Hombres
   - Impact: Core feature actually works!

4. **Error Handling & Debugging**
   - Added backend logging to /tmp/screenplay-backend.log
   - Proper toast notification lifecycle
   - Version display for cache verification
   - Impact: Can actually debug issues now

5. **Coverage Report-Style UX Redesign** (Session 3)
   - Built CoverageReportDashboard component (title page with scores)
   - Created EngagementGraph component (EKG-style with clickable beats)
   - Built CoverageReportTabs (Opening Thoughts, Characters, Plot, Structure, etc.)
   - Created SceneBySceneView ("Dive Deeper" mode)
   - Redesigned AnalysisResults to integrate all new components
   - Installed shadcn/ui tabs component
   - Version bumped to 0.2.0
   - Impact: Professional coverage report interface like WeScreenplay samples

**Critical**: 0
**High**: 0
**Medium**: 0

## Recent Decisions

### Decision 001: GUI-First Approach
**Date**: Oct 24, 2025
**Decision**: Build web GUI frontend, not CLI tool
**Reasoning**: Following universal pattern (GUI unless explicitly requested otherwise)
**Alternatives Considered**: CLI tool, but less user-friendly

---

## Metrics

### Features Complete (Phase 2 - Frontend)
- React setup: 100% (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind configured)
- Modern libraries: 100% (shadcn/ui, zustand, react-query, react-hook-form, sonner installed)
- Upload interface: 100% (drag-and-drop, validation, toast feedback)
- Select reviewers: 100% (already existed)
- Display system: 0% (needs work)
- Documentation: 100%

**Phase 2 Overall**: 30% complete (2 of 5 major features working)

---

## What's Next

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Set up React + Vite + TypeScript frontend
2. Install shadcn/ui + Lucide icons
3. Build upload interface

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Complete Phase 2 (GUI Frontend)
2. Build API layer (Phase 3)

- Filled in ROADMAP.md with 4 phases
- Filled in STATUS.md with current state
- About to commit documentation

**Key Insights**:
1. Backend is substantial and complete (Phase 1: 100%)
2. Frontend is empty skeleton (Phase 2: 0%)
3. Need GUI + API layer to make it usable
4. 25% overall progress (backend only, 0 end-user features)
